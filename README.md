# BlackRoad OS – Prism Console

Operator / admin console for BlackRoad OS services. This frontend surfaces system health, environment metadata, and operator workflows for the broader BlackRoad OS platform.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript

## Getting Started
Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Build & Start
Production build and runtime (default port 8080 for deployment targets like Railway):

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for available variables. Key values:
- `OS_ROOT` – base BlackRoad OS root URL
- `SERVICE_BASE_URL` – public URL for this console
- `CORE_API_URL`, `AGENTS_API_URL` – optional upstream APIs

## Health & Info
- `/api/health` – health payload including service id and readiness
- `/api/info` – static metadata about the Prism Console service
- `/api/version` – version and environment snapshot
- `/api/debug-env` – safe environment surface for troubleshooting

## Deployment (Railway)

This repository is configured for deployment on [Railway](https://railway.app) with the following setup:

### Automatic Configuration
The repository includes Railway configuration files:
- `railway.toml` – Railway deployment configuration (recommended)
- `railway.json` – Legacy Railway configuration (deprecated but supported)
- `nixpacks.toml` – Nixpacks build configuration

### Required Environment Variables
Set these in your Railway service settings:
- `NODE_ENV=production` (automatically set by Railway)
- `PORT` (automatically provided by Railway)

### Optional Environment Variables
For full functionality, configure:
- `SERVICE_BASE_URL` – Public URL of this console (e.g., `https://console.blackroad.systems`)
- `OS_ROOT` – Base BlackRoad OS root URL (e.g., `https://blackroad.systems`)
- `CORE_API_URL` – Core API endpoint (optional)
- `AGENTS_API_URL` – Agents API endpoint (optional)
- `PUBLIC_CONSOLE_URL` – Public console URL (optional)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_OS_ROOT` – Client-side OS root URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_ID=console`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_NAME="BlackRoad OS – Prism Console"`

### Deployment Details
- **Build Command**: Automatically detected from `package.json` (`npm run build`)
- **Start Command**: Automatically detected from `package.json` (`npm start`)
- **Health Check**: `/api/health` (configured in `railway.toml`)
- **Port**: Dynamically assigned by Railway via `$PORT` environment variable

### Manual Deployment
If deploying manually or with custom settings:
1. Build: `npm install && npm run build`
2. Start: `npm start` (uses standalone Next.js server)
3. Ensure `PORT` environment variable is set

### Healthcheck Response
The `/api/health` endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "service": "console",
  "status": "ok",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
